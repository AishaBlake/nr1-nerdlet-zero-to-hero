# ![Hero](./resources/icon.png)Nerdlet Fundamentals: Zero to Hero

A self-paced introduction to custom application (nerdlet) development for New Relic One.

This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of how to build your own complex applications from scratch. During the course you will build a sample application using custom components learning key concepts throughout. The chapters are intended to be worked through in turn, each builds upon the work of the previous. 

Each chapter contains a `/code` folder that has the application code as it stands from the end of the chapter.
